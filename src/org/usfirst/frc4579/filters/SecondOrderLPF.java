 * Property of FRC TEAM 4579 - RoboEagles
 * v1.0 | 03/19/2015
 * Lead Programmer, Jaden Bottemiller
 * 
 * This class is intended to be used as a second order low pass filter for inputs to another system.
 * For example: a joystick input to a motor controller
 * 
 * The output of the filter() method is what needs to be fed into the other system
 * E.G. motor.filter(1);
 *
 * The coefficients involved are calculated very precisey, and are very sensitive to changes
 * A change by one-hundredth of a decimal place can drastically affect the output of the filter
 * It is advised to let the class calculate its own coefficients given a cutoff frequency and a 
 * bandwidth for the input frequency
